    "You can merge these datasets with data from different regions if you like! For instance, you might want to compare **Bala, Pennsylvania, United States** to Ann Arbor, USA. In that case at least one source file must be about **Bala, Pennsylvania, United States**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to choose datasets at your discretion, but keep in mind **they will be shared with your peers**, so choose appropriate datasets. Sensitive, confidential, illicit, and proprietary materials are not good choices for datasets for this assignment. You are welcome to upload datasets of your own as well, and link to them using a third party repository such as github, bitbucket, pastebin, etc. Please be aware of the Coursera terms of service with respect to intellectual property.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "* Wikipedia is an excellent source of data, and I strongly encourage you to explore it for new data sources.\n",
    "* Many governments run open data initiatives at the city, region, and country levels, and these are wonderful resources for localized data sources.\n",
    "* Several international agencies, such as the [United Nations](http://data.un.org/), the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/), the [Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/place/) are other great places to look for data.\n",
    "* This assignment requires you to convert and clean datafiles. Check out the discussion forums for tips on how to do this from various sources, and share your successes with your fellow students!\n",

    "Each year, millions of NFL fans participate in fantasy football.  Fantasy football allows to create their own team made up of real NFL players, regardless of actual team.  In typical NFL fantasy leagues, there are twelve teams.  These teams need to select at least 1 quaterback, 2 running backs, 2 wide receives, 1 tight end, 1 kicker, and 1 defense.  Fantasy team owners fill out their teams usually through a draft.  Fnatasy owners attempt to select players who will perform well in real life and amass fantasy points for their team.  Fantasy points are awarded through a variety of scoring philosophies.  \n",
